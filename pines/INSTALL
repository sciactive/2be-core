                 -- Installation Instructions --

           ** These instructions are preliminary and **
         ** will not apply to future releases of Pines.**

This release of Pines is in the Alpha stage of development, which means that
many features are incomplete and subject to radical change or even complete
removal. You should not install this version of Pines in a production
environment. It is only being released for testing and evaluation purposes.

There is no Pines installer at this stage in development, so installation
must be done manually. You will need PHP version 5.2.10 or greater and MySQL 5.0
or greater. These requirements are subject to change, and MySQL will not be
required in later releases of Pines.

Set up a database for Pines in your MySQL server. Use the SQL in the pines.sql
file to build the tables required for com_myentity. Put your database settings
in the following file:

components/com_mysql/defaults.php

Once Pines is configured for your database, you need to create an admin user. To
do this, point your browser to your Pines URL, then add this to the end:

?option=com_user&action=createadmin&secret=874jdiv8

This will create an administrator user with the credentials:
Username: admin
Password: password

Now you should log in and disable this "Create Admin" feature. You can use the
built in configurator. From the main menu go to

System->Configuration->Components->User Manager->Configure

check the box next to "Create Admin" (to set it to a non-default value), then
uncheck the checkbox that appears to the right of it.

Good luck. ;)
