A list of things to complete before the initial release of Dandelion.

Documentation. - Finish documentation on Components and Template.
Some sort of "front page" or "dashboard" system.
New templates.
Views. - Finish views for com_newsletter.
Installer.
Dependency checker.
Logging.
Better default template. - http://matthewjamestaylor.com/blog/ultimate-3-column-holy-grail-pixels.htm
Possibly change structure to dirs (bud (models), grow, travel (views)) to replace single files for MVC.
Dandelion Entity Exchange (com_dex, for easily combining two installation's entities, using hooks, effectively creating a mirror)
Object Oriented Hooks ( $config->hooks->com_component->event[] = function() )

Group Heirarchy
