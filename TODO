A list of things to complete before the initial release of Dandelion.

New templates.
Views.
Installer.
Dependency checker.
Possibly change structure to dirs (bud (models), grow, travel (views)) to replace single files for MVC.
Dandelion Entity Exchange (com_dex, for easily combining two installation's entities, using hooks, effectively creating a mirror)
Object Oriented Hooks ( $config->hooks->com_component->event[] = function() )
