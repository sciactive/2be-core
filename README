This version of Pines is incomplete and many changes are coming, possibly even
major structural changes.

A list of things to complete before the initial release of Pines:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+Views. - Finish views for com_newsletter.
+Change configuration settings to use something more easily parsable, like XML,
    or INI (parse_ini_file function)
+Installer/Package Manager/Dependency checker
+Object Oriented Hooks ( $config->hooks->com_component->event[] = function() )
    (Before and after a function/event)
+Logging.
+Possibly change structure to dirs (models, control, views) to
    replace single files for MVC. (Use glob function to find files.)
+New templates.
+(2.0 Probably) Pines Entity Exchange (com_pex, for easily combining two
    installation's entities, using hooks, effectively creating a mirror)
