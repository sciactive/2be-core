This version of Pines is incomplete and many changes are coming, possibly even
major structural changes.

A list of things to complete before the initial release of Pines:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+Change configuration settings to use something more easily parsable, like XML,
    or INI (parse_ini_file function)
+Documentation. - Finish documentation on Components and Template.
+New templates.
+Views. - Finish views for com_newsletter.
+Installer/Package Manager/Dependency checker
+Logging.
+Possibly change structure to dirs (bud (models), grow, travel (views)) to
    replace single files for MVC. (Use glob function to find files.)
+Pines Entity Exchange (com_pex, for easily combining two installation's
    entities, using hooks, effectively creating a mirror)
+Object Oriented Hooks ( $config->hooks->com_component->event[] = function() )
    (Before and after a function/event)
