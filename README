This version of Pines is incomplete and many changes are coming, possibly even
major structural changes.

Read the INSTALL file for installation instructions.

A list of things to complete before the initial release of Pines:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+Installer/Package Manager/Dependency checker
+More log entries.
+Possibly change structure to dirs (models, control, views) to
    replace single files for MVC. (Use glob function to find files.)
+New templates / Improve Pines template.
+(2.0 Probably) Pines Entity Exchange (com_pex, for easily combining two
    installation's entities, using hooks, effectively creating a mirror)
