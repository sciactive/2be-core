-Installation Instructions-

These instructions are preliminary and will not apply to future releases of
XROOM.

There is a xroom.sql file with the current state of the database.

There are configure.php files in the root dir and in some component dirs. These
files contain settings that XROOM needs to run. You should edit these files
to suit your server's configuration.

Basically, to install XROOM, you currently need PHP and MySQL. Set up a
database for XROOM and put the settings in

/components/com_mysql/configure.php

Once you install XROOM, if you use com_user, you need to create an admin
user. To do this, point your browser to your XROOM installation, then add
this to the URL:

?option=com_user&action=createadmin&secret=874jdiv8

The secret is stored in /components/com_user/actions/createadmin.php
You should delete that file after you create an admin user.

The new administrator's credentials are

Username: admin
Password: password

Good luck. ;)
