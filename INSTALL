environment.

## Requirements for WonderPHP ##
	* PHP (v5.3 and up)

## Requirements for the Database Backends ##
	* MySQL (v5.0 and up)
	or
	* PostgreSQL (v8.4 and up) (Installing the PL/Perl extension will
	  significantly improve performance in most scenarios.)

## Installation Steps ##
	1. Extract WonderPHP to your server.
	2. Go to its address in a browser.
	3. Follow the steps to setup your database.
	4. Register a new user, by selecting the "I'm new." option. The system will

	   abilities.

Good luck. ;)
