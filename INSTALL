-Installation Instructions-

These instructions are preliminary and will not apply to future releases of
Pines.

There is a pines.sql file with the current state of the database.

Basically, to install Pines, you currently need PHP and MySQL. Set up a database
for Pines, run the pines.sql file on it, and put the settings in

/components/com_mysql/configure.php

Once you install Pines, if you use com_user, you need to create an admin user.
To do this, point your browser to your Pines installation, then add this to the
URL:

?option=com_user&action=createadmin&secret=874jdiv8

The secret is stored in /components/com_user/configure.php
You should set create_admin to false afterwards using the built in configuration
editor. (Configuration->Components->com_user->Configure->Create Admin)

The new administrator's credentials are

Username: admin
Password: password

Good luck. ;)
