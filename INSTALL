-Installation Instructions-

These instructions are preliminary and will not apply to future releases of
Dandelion.

There is a dandelion.sql file with the current state of the database.

There are configure.php files in the root dir and in some component dirs. These
files contain settings that Dandelion needs to run. You should edit these files
to suit your server's configuration.

Basically, to install Dandelion, you currently need PHP and MySQL. Set up a
database for Dandelion and put the settings in

/components/com_mysql/configure.php

Once you install Dandelion, if you use com_user, the administrator's credentials
are

Username: admin
Password: password

Good luck. ;)
